## Introduction

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using a pre-trained transformer model. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a piece of text. The project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library and fine-tunes a BERT model on a custom dataset for sentiment classification.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)


## Usage

    python sentiment_analysis.py
